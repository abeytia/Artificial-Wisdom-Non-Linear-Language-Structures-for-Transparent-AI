# Artificial-Wisdom-Non-Linear-Language-Structures-for-Transparent-AI
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project explores how the structure of non-linear languages—particularly Arabic and Japanese—can inspire AI systems that are more interpretable, culturally inclusive, and aligned with human reasoning. 
I aim to encourage the building of models that reflect wisdom, not just intelligence.

## Background

This project proposes using the structural logic of non-linear languages, particularly Arabic and Japanese Kanji, to redesign AI systems that are more interpretable, transparent and cognitively aligned with human reasoning. 
Instead of optimizing only for speed or fluency, we aim to build models that understand, reflect, and explain—systems designed not just for intelligence, but for wisdom.
Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This project addresses:
* The lack of transparency in AI decision-making
* The dominance of English in AI design logic
* The need for more place-based grounded and explainable AI systems


## How is it used?

This isn’t a consumer app or platform—it’s a **design philosophy** and emerging framework.

The ideas are intended for:
* AI researchers exploring interpretability  
* Policymakers concerned with ethical deployment  
* Communities advocating for inclusive and locally relevant technologies

It can guide how AI systems are developed and evaluated—particularly in multilingual and multicultural environments.

This project is currently conceptual and does not require a training dataset or build pipeline.# 30
However, future directions may involve:

## Data sources and AI methods

This project is currently conceptual and does not require a training dataset or build pipeline. However, future directions may involve:

* Arabic corpora with root–pattern tagging
* Japanese stroke-based Kanji datasets
* Open models using interpretable architectures and modified tokenization (e.g., [SPLINTER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14433))
   
```

## Data sources and AI methods

| Language     | Structure |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Arabic   |  Root–Pattern Morphology |
| Japanese   | Stroke + Radical Composition       |
| English (baseline) |  Linear Token Sequence     |

## Challenges

This project:
* Does not solve all technical or ethical problems in AI  
* Requires cultural and institutional change in AI development  
* Depends on future work to integrate non-linear structures into usable model architectures

Limitations also include:
* Lack of tooling for root- or stroke-aware transformers
* Potential resistance from performance-optimized engineering cultures

## What next?

Next steps include:
* Publishing an op-ed to invite public and academic discussion  
* Exploring collaborations with AI researchers or social technologists  
* Developing starter guides and design toolkits for educators and designers  

Skills needed to move forward:
* NLP research in Arabic and Japanese  
* Human-computer interaction design  
* Interdisciplinary ethics and AI interpretability expertise

  ## Acknowledgments and Inspiration

  This idea builds on the work of:
•	Scholars like Virginia Eubanks, Joy Buolamwini, and Ben Shneiderman, who push for ethical, human-centered AI
•	And the communities—especially in the Global South—who are often most impacted by AI but least consulted in its design
* Inspired by the work of Virginia Eubanks,  Joy Buolamwini, and Ben Shneiderman
* Informed by Arabic and Japanese linguistic traditions
* Developed through the Building AI course by the University of Helsinki
